						<p>They alone eat the stoneless all-sweet fruit of love who are beloved of those whom they hold dear.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>What the rain is to all the world, that is the tenderness of the beloved to her that loveth.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>They alone can pride themselves on their happiness who are loved in return by those whom they love.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>What if they are loved by others? If women receive not the affection of their beloved they know no happiness on earth.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>How can I hope for any favour from my beloved if he loveth me not even as I love him?</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Even as the burden on the carrying pole, love is pleasant only when it is on both sides: but it is a galling load when it is only on one side.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-60" id="noteref-60" epub:type="noteref">60</a></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The God of Love assaileth only me: is it because he hath no eyes for my sorrows and sufferings?</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>None in the world are so hard-hearted as women who continue to live on even when they receive no kind messages from their beloved.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Even if the beloved is unkind to us, any message that cometh from him is sweet to the ear.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Bless thee, my Heart! Thou wouldst tell thy grief to one who loveth thee not: thou mayest as well try to dry up the sea.</p>
